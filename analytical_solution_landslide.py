Analytical solution for the debris avalanche problem.
Input: X is the one-dimensional domain (grids);
       t is the time.
Output: u is the velocity in the x-direction;
        h is the height of the fluid;
        w is the stage that is w=h+z, where
        z is the one-dimensional topography;
        mom is the momentum in the x-direction.
Parameters: g is the gravity acceleration;
            h_0 is the constant initial height of fluid;
            c0 is square root of g*h_0;
            m is -g*tan(theta) + g*cos(theta)*cos(theta)*tan(delta), where
            theta is the topography angle and delta is the friction angle.
            Usually, tan(theta) and tan(delta) are given.
            Here, tan(theta) is the topography slope called bed slope.
